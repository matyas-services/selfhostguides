# Introduction to Self-Hosting

> Take control of your digital life by running your own apps and services.


## What is Self-Hosting?

**Self-hosting** means running software — like file storage, media servers, or websites — on your own hardware instead of relying on third-party cloud services (Google, Dropbox, etc).

You become your own cloud provider.

## Why Self-Host?

| Benefit         | Why it Matters                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Privacy      | Your data stays in your hands                        |
| 💰 Cost-saving  | No subscriptions — use your own hardware             |
| 🛠 Control       | Customize services to your needs                     |
| 🌐 Offline use   | Local access even without internet                   |
| 📚 Learning      | Improve your Linux, networking, and sysadmin skills |


## Common Myths

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "It's too hard!" | Many tools are plug-and-play now (e.g. Docker) |
| "You need expensive servers" | A Raspberry Pi or old laptop is enough |
| "It’s not safe" | With basic security (firewall, SSH), it can be very secure |


## What Can You Self-Host?

- **Media Servers** – Plex, Jellyfin
- **Cloud Storage** – Nextcloud, Seafile

| OS         | Linux (Ubuntu Server, Debian) |
| Network    | Router with port forwarding |
| Knowledge  | Basic command line and curiosity! |

1. Choose your hardware (Raspberry Pi, old laptop, VPS)
2. [Install a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu Server 22.04)](../linux-basics/introduction.md)
